# Data Analysis and Reporting Project

## About Me

Hello! I'm a passionate data and cybersecurity enthusiast with experience in leveraging data to provide actionable insights. I have an entry level background in Python, MySQL, and Power BI, and Iâ€™m currently focused on building my skills in data analytics and reporting. I enjoy automating data processes and creating visualizations that help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Overview

In this project, I have implemented an end-to-end data pipeline to collect, store, and visualize data from **Google Search** and **Google Analytics**. The solution was developed to streamline the data collection process and provide stakeholders with actionable insights via Microsoft Power BI. 

### Key Components:
1. **Google API Integration**: 
   - Set up APIs on Google to pull data from **Google Search** and **Google Analytics** using Python scripts.
   - Automated data extraction by writing Python scripts that interact with Google APIs to retrieve key metrics and dimensions.
   
2. **Data Storage**:
   - Designed and created a **MySQL database** on my local machine to store the extracted data.
   - Structured the database schema to accommodate data from both Google Search and Google Analytics, ensuring that it could handle large datasets efficiently.

3. **Power BI Integration**:
   - Connected the **MySQL database** to **Microsoft Power BI** to allow for seamless data refresh and visualization.
   - Created several **interactive visualizations** and reports in Power BI to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
   
### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For scripting and data extraction using the Google APIs.
- **Google Search & Google Analytics API**: To retrieve real-time search and analytics data.
- **MySQL**: For creating and managing the database to store the extracted data.
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data visualization and reporting.

### Project Benefits:
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Data from Google Analytics and Google Search is pulled automatically, reducing manual work and enabling up-to-date reporting.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Centralized data storage in a MySQL database ensures that data is easily accessible and scalable.
- **Visual Insights**: Power BI visualizations provide actionable insights for stakeholders and decision-makers, improving business intelligence and reporting.

## Future Improvements:
- **Scheduled Data Pulls**: Implement scheduling for data pulls to automate the process further.
- **Expanded Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources to provide more comprehensive insights to stakeholders.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more interactive visualizations and predictive analytics to forecast trends based on historical data.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis-Project.git`
   
2. Install necessary dependencies (Python, MySQL, Power BI Desktop):  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
3. Set up the Google APIs and connect them to the Python script.

4. Set up a local MySQL database and ensure the correct configuration to receive data.

5. Open the Power BI Desktop file to view the visualizations.
