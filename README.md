# Data Analysis and Reporting Project

## About Me
Hello! I'm a passionate data and cybersecurity enthusiast with experience in leveraging data to provide actionable insights. I have an entry-level background in Python, MySQL, and Power BI, and Iâ€™m currently focused on building my skills in data analytics and reporting. I enjoy automating data processes and creating visualizations that help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Goals
Through this project, I aim to enhance my skills in data collection, storage, and visualization. By integrating various technologies, I am building a comprehensive data pipeline that automates data extraction, provides stakeholders with clear visual insights, and helps improve business decision-making.

## Overview
In this project, I have implemented an end-to-end data pipeline to collect, store, and visualize data from Google Search and Google Analytics. The solution was developed to streamline the data collection process and provide stakeholders with actionable insights via Microsoft Power BI.

## Key Components:
- **Google API Integration**:
  - Set up APIs on Google to pull data from Google Search and Google Analytics using Python scripts.
  - Automated data extraction by writing Python scripts that interact with Google APIs to retrieve key metrics and dimensions.
  
- **Data Storage**:
  - Designed and created a MySQL database on my local machine to store the extracted data.
  - Structured the database schema to accommodate data from both Google Search and Google Analytics, ensuring that it could handle large datasets efficiently.
  
- **Power BI Integration**:
  - Connected the MySQL database to Microsoft Power BI to allow for seamless data refresh and visualization.
  - Created several interactive visualizations and reports in Power BI to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: For scripting and data extraction using the Google APIs.
- **Google Search & Google Analytics API**: To retrieve real-time search and analytics data.
- **MySQL**: For creating and managing the database to store the extracted data.
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data visualization and reporting.

## Project Benefits:
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Data from Google Analytics and Google Search is pulled automatically, reducing manual work and enabling up-to-date reporting.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Centralized data storage in a MySQL database ensures that data is easily accessible and scalable.
- **Visual Insights**: Power BI visualizations provide actionable insights for stakeholders and decision-makers, improving business intelligence and reporting.

## Future Improvements:
- **Scheduled Data Pulls**: Implement scheduling for data pulls to automate the process further.
- **Expanded Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources to provide more comprehensive insights to stakeholders.
- **Enhanced Visualizations**: Add more interactive visualizations and predictive analytics to forecast trends based on historical data.
